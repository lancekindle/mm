Randolf has been so kind to this man who has only treated him with scorn and dissinterest, and now he wants to fight. Randolf thinks Dr deserves a good Ass-kicking for his own mental health. He and Dr engage in fisticuffs, where Dr is flung into magnetic weights. Dr uses them to knock into the side of Randolf. Randolf, who disabled his Ultrasonic treatments a year ago (and hasn&apos;t exercised because of the pain), has extremely low bone density. He gets seriously injured, with internal bleeding, and broken ribs. Dr believes that Randolf will die soon if he is not treated properly.
