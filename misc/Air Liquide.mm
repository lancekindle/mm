<node TEXT="Gas Chromatographs (GC&apos;s) were obtained to monitor the purity of our delivered H2 gas. We used a set of two GC&apos;s for each Hydrogen production system. Each GC was responsible for separating the Hydrogren gas into H2, N2, and CO. GC#1 would monitor N2 purity, while GC#2 would monitor CO purity, as each had to report less than 1.5 ppm of said gas.&#xa;Since we had four H2Gen&apos;s, we setup a system to total reported gas purity of the H2Gens, with the ability to individually monitor a specific H2Gen&apos;s purity. Then we had a pair of GC&apos;s monitoring the 60k&apos;s output, and a pair monitoring the 45k&apos;s output. Finally we had a pair of GC&apos;s which allowed us to monitor the overall pipeline purity in case any particular GC pair went defunct. The pipeline GC&apos;s also had the option to instead monitor the 45k, since those GC&apos;s were oldest and notoriously spotty." ID="ID_1359913095" CREATED="1459204556136" MODIFIED="1459205656206"/>
<node TEXT="GC&apos;s work by diffusing the gases during several loops and diverting / venting gas flows at key times to separate gases, until the final gas mixture running through the heated mercury bed is Helium and Nitrogen (or CO). A light emitter and light sensor then sense the varying absorption levels of the mercury vapor to determine the concentration. Due to this separation process based on timing, the concentration is measured in intervals. Not continuously. Each sampling interval is about 5 minutes."

<node TEXT="piping is all tiny, tiny 1/8th or 1/16th piping, and a minimal number of parts are used to reduce cost and complexity of the device. Mechanical devices like tiny needle-valves controlling the rate of gas venting and introduction, combined with a heated coiled mass of 1/8th tubing with some catalyst/compound to diffuse the gas, and even a simple 1/8th tube crimped and venting to atmosphere to control the rate of gas flow. All these factors combine to make a device that requires device-specific calibration and fiddling. But once it works, it&apos;ll generally continue to work, until the diverting valve starts grinding, or the heating element (for the catalyst bed) starts failing, or the UV-lamp for the mercury bed starts failing."

<node TEXT="Helium is the primary &quot;neutral&quot; gas used to drive the flow of hydrogen, CO, and N2. As the gas is separated, to keep the volume of gas constant, helium is introduced into the mix. The special diverting valves (two of them). Alternate between sending as though the catalyst bed to venting. Monthly maintenance involves sending pure Helium through the GC catalyst bed to drive out absorbed gases and &quot;purify&quot; the bed. Without this, the bed would eventually saturate and be unable to effectively separate the gases." ID="ID_1385079224" CREATED="1459206334608" MODIFIED="1459206550705"/>

<node TEXT="after a large turnaround, we began to experience high-pressure in the glycol line. In desperation (to prevent plant shutdown), we began bleading out glycol and realized the line was very frothy. We rigged a system to bleed the glycol into a barrel and pumped it back into the line after it had de-frothed. For several days this was happening. We assumed there was a pocket of air that was being drained from when we had changed a portion of the glycol setup in our turnaround. But after the 3rd day... I began to get suspicious. We had just bled out too much air by that point. Somehow air must be getting introduced into the system." ID="ID_1582570580" CREATED="1466537282380" MODIFIED="1466537566747"/>
<node TEXT="There were only a few ways gas could get into the system. Nitrogen gas was present throughout our plant at pressures &gt; 60psi (which was what our glycol line ran). So I bled out ~5 gallons of the glycol froth into a container and held my air monitor inside the barrel. It didn&apos;t read low oxygen, so that meant it was NOT full of nitrogen. That left only our air compressors as a likely culprit. To test those, I cycled each one off for an hour (we had ~5 running). I quickly located the problematic one: compressor #3. Once compressor #3 was off, the glycol pressure stabilized." ID="ID_1208677489" CREATED="1466537568288" MODIFIED="1466537775977"/>
<node TEXT="Knowing it was the compressor, I next needed to drill down to which intercooler was leaking (the intercooler was the only place where pressurized air and glycol come close to each other). I opened the drains for each intercooler air-side chamber and drained to a bucket.&#xa;For a full day, nothing showed up. The next day, intercooler #2 had begun to show some leaking glycol. And that&apos;s how I proved intercooler 2 was at fault." ID="ID_1530561023" CREATED="1466537776470" MODIFIED="1466537890655"/>
<node TEXT="Then I had to schedule our compressor guy to come help take out the intercooler. And I talked to the Cameron guys to get a quote for buying a new intercooler. Once we pulled out the intercooler and proved it was at fault, I got the go-ahead to purchase the new intercooler.&#xa;Then I had to order new piping gaskets (we had ruined some while putting them back on the first time).  Eventually we got the new system setup." ID="ID_1412362979" CREATED="1466537931868" MODIFIED="1466538143312"/>
<node TEXT=" But as we were looking to pump glycol back into the system, I realized that there were two large vertical portions of the glycol legs that would remain filled with air. This was WAY too much air to leave, so I talked to the rest of the guys about it, and figured it would be easiest to put a tap in the piping. So I drew up the changes in the redlines, then obtained the cost from a local welding contractor, and scheduled them to come in and weld in new taps. Finally, FINALLY that was done and we could fill up the glycol lines and put the compressor back into service." ID="ID_782134056" CREATED="1466538143947" MODIFIED="1466538351603"/>

<node TEXT="After a turnaround, we had the hydrochem up and running and ready to go into the pipeline. We just needed to verify the purity. So the guys started up the GCs (gas chromatographs) and very quickly got a satisfactory purity. I was a little suspicious though. It was too good, too soon. So I traced the gas sample line from where it&apos;s pulled to the GC, checking that all the valves were open. INSIDE the GC casing, I found a valve that had been closed during turnaround. Notified the guys and I opened it (after confirming with them). Gas purity shot to hell, and it took another 5 hours before the purity became good enough. So I saved us from accidentally pumping a whole load of impure hydrogen into our pipeline." ID="ID_1415844819" CREATED="1466538404755" MODIFIED="1466538592645"/>

<node TEXT="As I was looking at the piping I noticed a brief *csshhhh* sound. I stood stock still, and waited but it didn&apos;t repeat. As I was investigating the nearby piping, I heard it again; This time I knew it was coming from the flow control valves. So I watched it. About 10 minutes later, the flow valve does a quick &quot;adjustment&quot;. I realized that our flow control valve was behaving slightly irrationally. So luckily we have two flow-control valves on that piping, both of which control the pressure at a set-point. So I swapped the two flow-control valves set-points so that the glitchy one would be at 100% open. This set the good fcv to do most of the regulating. I let the other guys know what I had done, and we all discussed getting a technician to come fix it" ID="ID_328737531" CREATED="1466538768706" MODIFIED="1466539118879"/>
