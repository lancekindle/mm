A repository of my mindmaps for languages and projects which I have worked on.
Not intended for public consumption (mind maps are inevitably context-sensitive to my own experience when writing them), but anyone is welcome to use them should my notes prove useful.

Note to self:
after pulling repo, pull submodule with
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
